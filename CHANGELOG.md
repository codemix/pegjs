Change Log
==========

This file documents all notable changes to Peggy.

1.2.0
-----

Released: TBD

### Minor Changes

- `location()`s now will have additional `source` property which value is taken
  from the `options.grammarSource` property. That property can contain arbitrary
  data,for example, path to the currently parsed file.

1.1.0
-----

Released: 2021-04-22

### Major Changes

- Added global initializer blocks, which contain code that is only run once
  when the grammar is loaded, rather than once every time the parser runs.
  Global initializers are surrounded by `{{` and `}}`, and must come before
  the per-parser initializer, which is surrounded by `{` and `}`.
  [@jaubourg](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/73)
- Back-ported value plucking with `@` from pegjs head.  If your rule has a simple action that returns one or more of the values matched by the rule, you can instead mark those expressions with `@` and not need an action.  This works inside of parens as well.  [@hildjj](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/89)
