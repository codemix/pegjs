### Minor Changes

- Infrastructural rebake [@StoneCypher](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/107)
    - Builds with `typescript`, removes `babel`
    - Bundles with `rollup`, removes `webpack`
        - Rollup is configured to create two bundles - es6 and umd
        - Only umd is exposed; will expose es6 with #119
    - Tests with `jest`, removes `mocha`
        - Enables coverage analysis using `lcov` notation
        - Coverage is not archived; will archive with #120
    - Minifies with `terser`, removes `uglify`
    - Adds `rimraf` for portable pre-build cleanup
    - Extends CI testing to `windows`, `macintosh`
    - Increases node testing range to include `node 16`
    - Adds an announcer to make the build process more readable
- `location()`s now will have additional `source` property which value is taken
  from the `options.grammarSource` property. That property can contain arbitrary
  data,for example, path to the currently parsed file.

1.1.0
-----

Released: 2021-04-22

### Major Changes

- Added global initializer blocks, which contain code that is only run once
  when the grammar is loaded, rather than once every time the parser runs.
  Global initializers are surrounded by `{{` and `}}`, and must come before
  the per-parser initializer, which is surrounded by `{` and `}`.
  [@jaubourg](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/73)
- Back-ported value plucking with `@` from pegjs head.  If your rule has a simple action that returns one or more of the values matched by the rule, you can instead mark those expressions with `@` and not need an action.  This works inside of parens as well.  [@hildjj](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy/pull/89)
