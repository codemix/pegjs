# Peggy documentation

This directory contains all of the code for building and deploying the Peggy documentation site. The site is built using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.

## Building the site

To build the site for production, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

For local development, you can use the development server which will watch changes and rebuild the site automatically. To do this, run:

```sh
npm run start
```
